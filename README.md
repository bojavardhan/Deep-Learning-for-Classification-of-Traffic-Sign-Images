# Deep-Learning-for-Classification-of-Traffic-Sign-Images
Traffic sign recognition (ATSR) is a significant feature of intelligent transportation systems that contribute to driver protection, pedestrian safety, and automobile safety. The development of TSR systems requires the use of computer vision techniques, which is considered to be essential for pattern recognition in general. Classification and identification of traffic signs remain a very challenging issue for all of the previous works and research that have been accomplished, precisely if we want a solution for real-time processing. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize traffic signs on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark (GTSRB). The proposed system functions to identify and realize traffic sign images. This paper also refers to a newly produced series of 24 different traffic signs from random roadsides, collected in Saudi Arabia. The photographs were taken from different angles and with some parameters and conditions included. The CNN model was used with varying factors to obtain the highest rate of recognition. Research results indicate that the new CNN architecture has gained 97% accuracy, higher than those obtained in similar earlier tests.
